TimeLine Widget
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: ../_static/timeline.png

.. note:: This widget is ReadOnly so no data input is send on form submit.

2 requirements must be achieved to use these widgets


- Create a lookup channel in ``app/gttimeline.py`` based in the model we want to use as options in the widget.
- Replace default widget in form with ``UrlTimeLineInput``.


-------------------------------------
Defining Lookups for usage in widgets
-------------------------------------
An example on how a lookup must be defined:

.. code:: python

    import datetime
    from djgentelella.groute import register_lookups
    from djgentelella.views.timeline import BaseTimelineView

    @register_lookups(prefix="timeline", basename="exampletimeline")
    class TimelineExample(BaseTimelineView):
        def get_title(self):
            pass
        def get_events(self):
            return []
        def get_scale(self):
            return 'human'
        def get_eras(self):
            return []

Based in above example we need:

- A decorator named register_lookups defined above the lookup class that receives two parameters:
    - A prefix, which is basically the model name in lowcaps
    - A basename, which is a meaningful name that will help you differentiate between multiple lookups
- A class that inherits from the custom class BaseTimelineView which is responsible of creating an url that exposes the model data in a way the widget urderstands it, so to make it works the class needs overwrite the methods.

--------------------
Usage in forms.py
--------------------

In model based form:

.. code:: python

    from djgentelella.widgets.timeline import UrlTimeLineInput
    from djgentelella.forms.forms import GTForm
    from django.urls import reverse_lazy
    class PeopleLineForm(GTForm, forms.ModelForm):
        timeline = forms.CharField(widget=UrlTimeLineInput(
                attrs={"data-url": reverse_lazy('exampletimeline-list'),
                        'style': "height: 500px;",
                         "data-option_language": 'es'
                }), required=False)
        class Meta:
            model = models.MyModel
            fields = '__all__'


As noticed in above example, the last steps are:
 - Create a CharField with widget as UrlTimeLineInput add data-url including the basename plus -list.
 - Se field as required = False

You can set initial data with form(initial={}) changing the data-url attribute when value is not None on the field.

--------------------------------------
Passing options to timelineJS3
--------------------------------------

You can pass timelineJS3 options using data attrs in widget attr parameter.
In the example ``data-option_language`` the prefix ``data-`` is used to indicate data Html element, the section ``option\_``  is used to indicate that this attribute is a
timeline option and ``language`` is the option name.

More see: https://timeline.knightlab.com/docs/options.html

.. Note::  Static files for this widget are not loaded by default so you need to load CSS and JS for this widget to prevent.

You can define what library you want using ``define_true`` tag, in this way:

.. code:: html

    {% load gtsettings %}
    {% block pre_head %}
        {% define_true  "use_readonlywidgets" %}
    {% endblock %}

or set on setting.py the follow dict to load always all static

.. code:: python

    DEFAULT_JS_IMPORTS = {
        'use_readonlywidgets': True
    }
