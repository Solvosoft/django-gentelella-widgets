Storyline Widget
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: ../_static/storyline.png

.. note:: This widget is ReadOnly so no data input is send on form submit.

2 requirements must be achieved to use these widgets


- Create a lookup channel in ``app/gtstoryline.py`` based in the model we want to use as options in the widget.
- Replace default widget in form with ``UrlStoryLineInput``.


-------------------------------------
Defining Lookups for usage in widgets
-------------------------------------
An example on how a lookup must be defined:

.. code:: python

    import datetime
    from djgentelella.groute import register_lookups
    from djgentelella.views.storyline import StorylineBuilder

    @register_lookups(prefix="storyline", basename="examplestoryline")
    class StorylineExample(StorylineBuilder):

        def create_options(self):
            pass
        def create_csv(self):
            return []

Based in above example we need:

- A decorator named register_lookups defined above the lookup class that receives two parameters:
    - A prefix, which is basically the model name in lowcaps
    - A basename, which is a meaningful name that will help you differentiate between multiple lookups
- A class that inherits from the custom class StorylineBuilder which is responsible of creating an url that exposes the model data in a way the widget urderstands it, so to make it works the class needs to overwrite the methods.

--------------------------------------
Details on the methods override:
--------------------------------------

- Create options: This method should return a dictionary containing the storyline settings, with the following characteristics:
    - a "data" dictionary containing three obligatory fields:
        - datetime_column_name: a case and space sensitive string that is the value in the first row of the column containing the dates for the X-coordinates of the chart.
        - datetime_format: a string that tells StorylineJS how to interpret the value in your datetime_column. The format should be as specified with [`d3-time-format`](https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/blob/master/README.md#locale_format)
        - data_column_name: a a case and space sensitive string that is the value in the first row of the column of your file which has the values to be used for the Y-coordinates of the chart.

    - a "chart" object with the following keys:
        - datetime_format: a string telling StorylineJS how to display dates, used mostly for the X-axis labels, but also used for cards if no display_date is specified. The format should be as specified with [`d3-time-format`](https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/blob/master/README.md#locale_format)
        - y_axis_label *(optional)*: Use this to indicate the units for the Y values in your chart. If this is left out, then `data.data_column_name` will be used.

    - a "slider" dictionary that contains the following attributes:
        - start_at_card: A string defining at which card you want the slider to be positioned when first rendered,
        - title_column_name: The exact title of the column with the titles information,
        - text_column_name: The exact name of the column with the texts information,

- Create csv: this method should return a list of strings, where the first string contains the datetime-column name, the data-column name, the title column name and the text column name (they should match with the information assigned in the options object.
    - CSV format should be separated by commas, and the quantity of columns of the data cannot surpass the columns in the header row (the first one)
    - It could have less columns than the header, nonetheless needs at least the first two, containing datetime and data information, otherwise will fail.

--------------------
Usage in forms.py
--------------------

In model based form:

.. code:: python

    from djgentelella.widgets.storyline import UrlStoryLineInput
    from djgentelella.forms.forms import GTForm
    from django.urls import reverse_lazy
    class PeopleLineForm(GTForm, forms.ModelForm):
        storyline = forms.CharField(widget=UrlStoryLineInput(
                attrs={"data-url": reverse_lazy('examplestoryline-list'),
                        "height: 500, "width": 600",
                         "data-url_name": 'examplestoryline'
                }))
        class Meta:
            model = models.MyModel
            fields = '__all__'


As noticed in above example, the last steps are:
 - Create a CharField with widget as UrlStoryLineInput add data-url including the basename plus -list.
 - It is mandatory to also send "height" and "width" in the attributes, as well as a "data-url_name" field with the exact basename. (used internally to redirection).

You can set initial data with form(initial={}) changing the data-url attribute when value is not None on the field.



In the example ``data-url_name`` the prefix ``data-`` is used to indicate data Html element, and ``url_name`` is the attribute name.

.. Note::  Static files for this widget are not loaded by default so you need to load CSS and JS for this widget to prevent.

You can define what library you want using ``define_true`` tag, in this way:

.. code:: html

    {% load gtsettings %}
    {% block pre_head %}
        {% define_true  "use_readonlywidgets" %}
    {% endblock %}

or set on setting.py the follow dict to load always all static

.. code:: python

    DEFAULT_JS_IMPORTS = {
        'use_readonlywidgets': True
    }
